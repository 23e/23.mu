Mathias Schulenberg, a fan, created this music video, and I am completely blown away! It's trippy, glitchy, and extremely musical.  Those of you who are fans of pokemon and my Let's Go To Lavender Town track will love it, I'm sure!

Stay tuned because judging is just about done for the FUCK YOU remix contest! So results will be out real soon!

Apart from that, check my tour dates to see if I'm playing in your area any time soon!
