Throughout the month of november, I will be growing a mustache, to support the awareness of mens health issues, and to try and raise funds for prostate cancer research!

I've begun work immediately on a mustache themed song- that will be given away to donators (Or I shall release it via other mediums and all proceeds will go directly to my Movember fun raiser).

Donate by clicking "here":http://mobro.co/TwentyThree

Regardless, you should totally donate some money because it's for a good cause. If you'd like to join me, I'm the captain of a team called the "Bass Music Mustaches," and we're representing the Bass community for Movember! I encourage you to rock a 'stache for a good cause!
