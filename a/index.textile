23 began taking music seriously at the age of 14, when he got his first guitar. He started playing solos and working on his technical abilities until he could match his idols like Steve Vai, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, etc. After about 1.5 years of guitar playing, practicing approximately 6 hours a day, he was able to shred at a proficient level, and joined a Progressive/Power metal band as the lead guitarist. His band would eventually go on to create original material and cover bands like Dragonforce, Dream Theater, and Symphony X.

Setting his sights on Berklee College of Music, he began taking lessons in music theory around the age of 16, and covered topics ranging from basic harmony to improvization to modal reharmonization.

Facing a sense of disillusionment by musicians and the music industry as a whole, 23 decided not to go to college for music, and instead went off to study Software Engineering. during his first 3 years in school, his practice diminished to 1 hour a week at most.

One summer, 23 moved to NYC and became deeply involved in the EDM scene. The impression left turned out to be integral to 23's future, as when he returned to school, he began to break his musicless habit, and dabble in producing electronic music.

In the summer of 2010, 23 purchesed a computer for production, and some studio monitors in order to motivate him to begin making and producing music again. When he returned to school however, his time diminished once again, and music was put on the sidelines.

In the mean time, 23 quickly picked up DJing, and began throwing house parties at his University apartment. 23 would try and make tracks to fit the theme of these parties, and this gave him just enough motivation to get his music production career off the ground.

He then began producing his Discordia EP, which he finished in Early 2011. When he posted the preview to "Reddit":http://reddit.com, he was met by a huge supportive response, and soon thereafter was signed by Heavy Artillery Recordings.

Since then, 23, has been balancing schoolwork and producion, working on new releases while he slowly climbs in popularity.
